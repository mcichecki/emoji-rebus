 # Emoji Rebus Playground
 
 Welcome to my **_Swift Student Challenge_** submission 👋
 
 ##### What is rebus?
 
 Rebus is a puzzle in which words are represented by a combination of pictures and letters, words, or parts of words.
 
 ##### About playground
 
 This playground lets you solve rebuses and learn about ecology and our planet Earth.
 
 Each rebus consists of letters and emojis instead of pictures.
 
 Every time you manage to solve the rebus you will see the answer with a short explanation.
 
 If you don't know the answer you can use **hint** button to insert correct letters at random position.
 There is also a **listen** button that lets you head the answer.
 
 ##### How to solve rebus
 
 Rebuses are quite easy to solve but if you have never solved one there are two examples (letters in brackets indicate that they should be removed):
 
 ### - RE + 🚌 = RE + BUS = **REBUS**
 ### - [L]🍋[N] + JI = [L]EMO[N] + JI = EMO + JI = **EMOJI**
